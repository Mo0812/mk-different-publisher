# Different Publisher Plugin
This Wordpress Plugin prevent backend user to publish their own posts, even if they have granted the rights to publish posts in general.

Every other user with the general rights to publish posts can still publish posts which are not created by himself.

In summary this plugin should provide a type of community publishing process where every post have at least been reviewed by one other editor to go to the productive website. Thereby no "super-editors" are needed to provide a smooth publishing process.
